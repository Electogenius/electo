# Maybe the smallest HTML editor
___
I spent like a minute making this:
```html
<input id=n oninput=f.srcdoc=n.value><iframe id=f>
```
... and as far as I know it is the smallest possible live html editor

Well it's barely usable but at least it automatically changes layout based on viewport width

Try it:
<iframe sandbox="allow-scripts" style="background-color:white" srcdoc="<input id=n oninput=f.srcdoc=n.value><iframe id=f>"></iframe>
