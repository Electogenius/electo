also yes there's a dark mode switcher "library" that sets the "data-dark" attribute of the body tag to "true" when in dark mode. It also adds a css link tag to average.css, which is just a bit of css I find useful when I'm too lazy. If you don't want average.css just add a data-customcss to the body tag
